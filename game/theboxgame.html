    <h1>DA BOX GAME</h1>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p> Hello there and welcome to the glorious world of the boxes.
        The boxes lived in peace, until one day player1 wanted to 
        battle player2. Then all out war began. Your goal is to
        defeat your partner by eliminating all of his boxes.
        You do this by constructing building, some of which can attack
        your opponent. But before you go on about slaughtering him/her/helicopter,
        you must first defeat them in good old classic rock papper and scissors.
        The winner then gets to make 1 action; whether it be to build or to attack,
        after the action is done the next rps begins, and it will continue until one
        player losses all of his 9 boxes. This project was inspired by Andrew and his bff
        Josh. Good luck and have fun. Github page will be posted soon!
