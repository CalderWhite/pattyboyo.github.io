    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This game is going to use my RPS's game mechanics, so if you haven't seen that go check it out<a href='pattyboyo.github.io/game/rps'> here </a>
       Anywho, hello there and welcome to my box game. Credits to Andrew Wangster and Joshywu for making 
      this game. The game is sort of complicated to explain, so here we go.
   </p>
   <h3>How to win</h3>
   <p>You win by attacking your opponent's boxes until they have all been hit.</p>
   <h3>Buildings</h3>
   <p>
     <strong>pistol:</strong> the pistol has one attack and one health, and can be upgraded to a 3 attack 1 health triple gun
     <strong>machine gun:</strong> a powerful 2 attack 3 health gun that need 2 turns to be set up, and when it's being built
     it can be upgraded into a 4 attack (with the original health) mini-gun.
     <strong>flag:</strong> a defensive building that can block 1 enemy attack, and can be upgraded into a triple flag that 
     blocks 3 attacks.
     <strong>More Buildings Coming Soon!</strong>
   </p>
   <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>
     The game starts with each player having nine lives (boxes). If any players loses all of these boxes, he/she loses. Each turn,
     you and your opponent will face off against one another in rock paper scissors, and the winner of that gets to spend their 
     turn doing one thing. They can either attack with one weapon, or build/upgrade something. This cycle repeats until one player
      loses all of their lives/boxes. More game mechanics coming soon.
